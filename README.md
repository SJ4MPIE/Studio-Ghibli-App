Loading in JSON (Javascript object notation) through API (Application programming interface)
Note: This repo is based of a tutorial written by Tania Rascia. 
However, in the tutorial they still make use of XHR objects(XMLHttpRequest JavaScript ES5) 
So I decided to update the code using the fetch() API (JavaScript ES6)
Version: 1.0
